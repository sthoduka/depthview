# 3D Camera viewer

New laptops will soon be shipping with 3D webcams. The official SDK from intel only supports windows.
This is a tool to get the data feed, and show video on Linux.

This branch currently requires a linux kernel patch to work.
Available as another branch on the same repo.
https://github.com/teknotus/depthview/tree/kernelpatchfmt

Prepatched Linux kernel available from [Ubuntu 14.10 PPA](https://launchpad.net/~teknotus/+archive/ubuntu/rs-kernel-ppa)

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:teknotus/rs-kernel-ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install linux-image-3.16.0-37-generic=3.16.0-37.49+realsense linux-headers-3.16.0-37-generic=3.16.0-37.49+realsense linux-image-extra-3.16.0-37-generic=3.16.0-37.49+realsense

There is also a userspace driver that works with the camera that I hope to add support for soon.
